# MapExtend for Xamarin.Forms
MapExtend for Xamarin.Forms is a plugin for Xamarin.Forms allowing users to draw routes, reveal nearby locations, and place pins at certain addresses.

## How to Download
[Download MapExtend](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugin.MapExtend/) using the [NuGet Package Manager](https://www.nuget.org/).

## Usage
### Initialization
When adding MapExtend to a Xamarin.Forms application,Xamarin.Forms.MapExtend is a a separate NuGet package that you should add to every project in the solution. On Android, this also has a dependency on GooglePlayServices (another NuGet) and Xamarin.Forms.Maps (too) which is downloaded automatically  when you add Xamarin.Forms.MapExtend.

After installing the NuGet package, the following initialization code is required in each application project:

MapExtendRenderer.Init();

This call should be made after the Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init() method call. The Xamarin.Forms templates have this call in the following files for each platform:

**iOS** - AppDelegate.cs file, in the FinishedLaunching method.

**Android** - MainActivity.cs file, in the OnCreate method.

**Windows Phone** - MainPage.xaml.cs file, in the MainPage constructor.

Once the NuGet package has been added and the initialization method called inside each applcation, Xamarin.Forms.MapExtend APIs can be used in the common PCL or Shared Project code.


## Platform Configuration

### iOS

On iOS 7 the map control "just works", so long as the MapExtendRenderer.Init() call has been made.

For iOS 8 two keys need to be added to the Info.plist file: NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription and NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription. The XML representation is shown below - you should update the string values to reflect how your application is using the location information:

<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Can we use your location</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>We are using your location</string>

The plist entries can also be added in Source view while editing the Info.plist

### Android

To use the Google Maps API v2 on Android you must generate an API key and add it to your Android project. Follow the instructions in the Xamarin doc on obtaining a Google Maps API v2 key. After following those instructions, paste the API key in the Properties/AndroidManifest.xml file (view source and find/update the following element):

<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY" android:value="YoApiKey" />

Without a valid API key the maps control will display as a grey box on Android.

You'll also need to enable appropriate permissions by right-clicking on the Android project and selecting Options > Build > Android Application and ticking the following:

* AccessCourseLocation
* AccessFineLocation
* AccessLocationExtraCommands
* AccessMockLocation
* AccessNetworkState
* AccessWifiState
* Internet
 
Use it to Init:
MapExtendRenderer.Init(this, bundle);

#### Windows Phone

The Map control and user location API in Windows Phone requires the ID_CAP_MAP and ID_CAP_LOCATION capabilities to be selected.

To set these values in a new Windows Phone app, open the Properties folder and double-click the WMAppManifest.xml file. Go to the Capabilities tab and tick ID_CAP_MAP and ID_CAP_LOCATION.

While you can debug your app with just the device capabilities set, apps must have an Authentication Token set before they are deployed to the Windows Phone store. Instructions are available on MSDN to add the ApplicationID and AuthenticationToken to a Windows Phone app.

To add the ApplicationID and AuthenticationToken to a Xamarin.Forms Windows Phone app, use the FormsMaps.Init method as shown below:

string applicationId = "APP_ID_FROM_PORTAL", authToken = "AUTH_TOKEN_FROM_PORTAL";
MapExtendRenderer.Init(applicationId, authToken);
